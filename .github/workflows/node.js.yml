# Description: This GitHub Actions workflow automates Node.js CI/CD for a Node.js project.
# It performs the following steps:

# Step 1: Check out the source code.
# Step 2: Set up different versions of Node.js for testing.
# Step 3: Perform a clean install of Node.js dependencies.
# Step 4: Ensure the project is clean, easy to read, debuggable, and maintainable. (Linting)
# Step 5: Cache and restore dependencies for faster builds.
# Step 6: Build the source code.
# Step 7: Run tests using different versions of Node.js.
# Step 8: Deploying to a staging environment on push to main
# Step 9: Manual approval for production deployment
